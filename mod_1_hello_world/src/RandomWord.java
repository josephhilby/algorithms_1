// NOTES FOR SELF
// ` $ javac -classpath "../lib/algs4.jar" RandomWord.java`
// This will assign the classpath in zsh (currently the java project plugin in VS is working to accomplish this im compile time but not run time)

// PROMPT
//Write a program RandomWord.java that reads a sequence of words from standard input
//and prints one of those words uniformly at random. Do not store the words in an
//array or list. Instead, use Knuthâ€™s method: when reading the ith word, select it
//with probability 1/i to be the champion,replacing the previous champion.
// After reading all of the words, print the surviving champion.

// PLEASE NOTE
// This is my first time with Java. For this class RandomWord, I relied heavily on code in the github repo listed below.
// https://github.com/camilamaia/jornada-big-tech/blob/main/coursera-algorithms-part-1/hello/RandomWord.java
// While I did build this file slowly and worked through the problem. I used the above repo for line 29 and 35.
